## Overview
The goal of this project was to interface the OV7670 camera with the PIC32MX795F512L microcontroller. 

##Microcontroller
The PIC32 was previously used in our Mechatronics classes and was sufficient for this project. The PIC32 is housed by a [NU32 development board](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/NU32:_Introduction_to_the_PIC32). This board also has a serial-to-USB converter which is useful for transmitting data from the camera to my computer. The camera communicates using SCCB (Serial Camera Control Bus). SCCB protocol is similar to I2C protocol and therefore I2C communication is used between the microcontroller and the camera. An I2C library was provided by Nick Marchuk for use in out Mechatronics class. The library as well as other downloads helpful for setting up the microcontroller with a computer can be found [here](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/NU32_Software) in the Full Book Source Code download. 

##Camera
The OV7670 with FIFO is a cheap CMOS camera. It requires a 3V power supply and is capable of taking 640x480 resolution pictures at up to 30 frames per second. 

####Camera Version

There are many available versions of the OV7670 camera. Some come with an additional AL422 FIFO chip which is helpful for image storage. With the FIFO chip the image can be stored on the chip and then read out later. Otherwise the image needs to be read out at the same time as it is being captured. There are two different versions available of the OV7670 cameras with the AL422 FIFO chip. The version used in this project is the 22 pin version

 | |
-----|------
VCC - 3.3V Input power supply|GND - Ground Input
SIOC - Used for I2C, connects to SCL pin on microcontroller|SIOD - Used for I2C, connects to SDA pin on microcontroller
VSYNC - Output that is high while a new frame is being output |HREF - Output that is high while a new row is being output
D7-D0 - Image data is output on these pins one byte at a time|
RST - Input to reset the camera|PWDN - Input to put the camera into power down mode
STR - Camera strobe output that can be used to turn on an LED light while the camera takes an image|RCK - Input for clock pulse, each clock cycle corresponds to a new byte
WR - Set high to enable the writing of data to the camera's frame buffer memory|OE(Output Enable) - Set high for valid camera output from the D7-D0 pins
WRST(Write reset) - Input pin that resets the frame buffer memory's write pointer|RRST(Read reset) - Input pin that resets the frame buffer memory's read pointer
