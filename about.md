## Overview
Athulya Simon is a recent graduate from Northwestern University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and soon an M.S. in Robotics. During her studies, she gained practical experience creating a Rotating Treat Dispenser for autism research, building an MRI Phantom for Cardiovascular Calibrations, various tasks with Baxter, and many more exciting projects.

As a member of the inaugural MSR cohort, Athulya continues to strengthen her problem solving and programming skills while gaining familiarity with cutting edge robotic applications. Her interests lie where the biomedical field intersects with robotics and artificial intelligence, in subfields such as prosthetics and surgical robotics. She has taken classes focused on the intricacies of artificial limbs and targeted muscle reinnervation, applying machine learning to computer vision and data analysis, robotic manipulation with embedded systems, and computational neuromechanics.

Outside of engineering, Athulya has interest in both music and sports. She was a member of the Northwestern University Marching Band throughout her undergraduate career and continued with Basketball Band during the Winter Quarter of MSR. She has also organized intramural sports teams with both the first and second MSR cohorts.
