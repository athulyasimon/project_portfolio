## Overview
Athulya Simon is a recent graduate from Northwestern University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering. During her studies, she gained practical experience creating a Rotating Treat Dispenser for autism research and building an MRI Phantom for Cardiovascular Calibrations.

As a member of the inaugural MSR cohort, Athulya continues to strengthen her problem solving and programming skills while gaining familiarity with cutting edge robotic applications. Her interests lie where the biomedical field intersects with robotics and artificial intelligence, in subfields such as prosthetics and surgical robotics. She is currently learning about the intricacies of artificial limbs and targeted muscle reinnervation, applying machine learning to computer vision and data analysis, and robotic manipulation with embedded systems.

Outside of engineering, Athulya has interest in both music and sports. She was a member of the Northwestern University Marching Band throughout her undergraduate career and is still a member of Basketball Band. She also organizes intramural sports teams with the MSR cohort.
